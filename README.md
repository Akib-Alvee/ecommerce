CSE 446 (WEB TECHNOLOGIES)

### Project: API Project:API-based websites to simulate the functionalities of e-commerce services among different organisations.

### Project Description: 

In our CSE 446: Web Technologies course we are building an API project where we are simulating the E-commerce functionalities among different organizations: an e-commerce company, a backend product supplier that provides the e-commerce company with the products it needs, and a bank that acts as a middleman to process transactions between the various players in this ecosystem. The primary features are as follows: a customer can purchase an unlimited quantity of one of the e-commerce company's products after successfully completing a bank transaction with the e-commerce company. After the e-commerce company processes the payment through the bank for these products, the supplier ships them out. The project's infrastructure is built on the Node.js and Express.js frameworks, with mongoDB serving as the underlying database and React.js providing a responsive frontend.

#### Used Technologies & Frameworks: 
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
